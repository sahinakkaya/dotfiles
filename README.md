# sahinakkaya's dotfiles

**Note: I have dropped old dotfiles completely and started from scratch. If you can't find the thing you are looking for here, check [old-dots](https://github.com/sahinakkaya/dotfiles/tree/old-dots) branch. In order to reduce the size of this repo, I also dropped all the git history of my old-dots.**


## Why start from scratch?
- I am tired of changing some part of my configuration when I switch between MacOS and Linux. I don't want to have a Hyprland configuration when I am on Mac. Similarly, I don't need yabai configuration when I am on Linux. In this fresh start, I will keep track of different branches for Mac and Linux and make sure they are up-to-date so installing them on a new machine will be smooth.

- I didn't want to use my old config as starting point because it hasn't been updated in a long time. I thought it would be easier to start from scratch and rewrite everything to suit my needs, rather than trying to adopt the old config to my current workflow.
